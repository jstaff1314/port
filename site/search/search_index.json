My name is Jaden Stafford, and I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Technical Writing and Communication. I began my time at university in the College of Science and Engineering as an astrophysics/computer science double major. After a semester, I was hit with the hard truth that my passion and skillset didn't align with this path. It was an unpleasant but necessary realization, and shortly after, I transferred directly into my current major program in the College of LIberal Arts. In January of 2021, I was hired as a copywriter for Boynton Health, the full service health clinic on the UMN campus. I worked for the marketing department alongside an incredibly talented team. During my time there, I helped launch large-scale marketing campaigns and worked closely with my team on fulfilling marketing requests from different departments. Through my time working at Boynton and completing my degree, I've learned many skills beyond what can be written on a resume. I've learned to value my creativity and build from criticism, to be adaptable but disciplined, and to always welcome collaboration. Now, I turn to the future to begin a career in copywriting. I look forawrd to putting my talents to use. Thank you for your consideration!","title":"Personal Statement"},{"location":"#personal-statement","text":"Hello and welcome to my porfolio!
