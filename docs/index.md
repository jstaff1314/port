# Personal Statement

Hello and welcome to my porfolio! My name is Jaden Stafford, and I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Technical Writing and Communication. 

I began my time at university in the College of Science and Engineering. After a semester, I realized it wasn't a good fit and transferred directly into my major program in the College of LIberal Arts. 

In January of 2021, I was hired as a copywriter for Boynton Health, the full service health clinic on the UMN campus. I worked for the marketing department alongside an incredibly talented team. During my time there, I helped launch marketing campaigns aligned with COVID-19 and Flu vaccinations. i also helped create a new, internal newsletter that now reaches all Boynton Health staff. 

Through my time working at Boynton and completing my degree, I've learned many valuable skills beyond what can be written on a resume. I've learned to value my creativity and build from criticism, to be adaptable but disciplined, and to always welcome collaboration. 

Now, I turn to the future to begin a career in copywriting. I look forawrd to putting my talents to use!

Thank you for your consideration.
