# Personal Statement

Hello and welcome to my porfolio! My name is Jaden Stafford, and I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in Technical Writing and Communication. 

I began my time at university in the College of Science and Engineering. After a semester, I realized it wasn't a good fit and transferred directly into my major program in the College of LIberal Arts. 

In January of 2021, I was hired as a copywriter for Boynton Health, the full service health clinic on the UMN campus.
